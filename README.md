The files in this directory are all related to a project aimed at understanding the importance of fish in Guinea worm disease transmission. The project involved a mesocosm experiment with fish and copepods. The results of the experiment were integrated into a Bayesian MCMC state space modeling framework. The parameter estimates were then incorporated into mechansitic models with GW parasites to assess the relative importance of fish to GW disease transmission.
